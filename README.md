# Advent of Code 2019 - Go

This repository main goal is to keep track of the work done for AoC 2019.
I've decided to do the event with the Go language (at least at the beginning).

With an absolute beginner level in Go, I've done some parts of the [https://tour.golang.org/](Tour of Go).

Refactoring the code is a long-term goal too.
